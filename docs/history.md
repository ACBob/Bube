    playing
-   optimized material rendering by grouping into larger surfaces
    (toggled by \"optmats\" var)
-   many tiny tweaks to the multiplayer gameplay
-   \"maxfps\" var for limiting fps
-   \"showmat\" var for rendering invisible materials and selecting
    materials in edit mode
-   edited cubes default to fullbright until calclight/patchlight
-   added coopedit support back in \| no map uploading yet\...

2006\_01\_31\_mp\_edition {#_2006_01_31_mp_edition}
-------------------------

-   disconnection messages now show why you were disconnected
-   multiplayer enemies show firing/pain animations
-   weapon pushback (esp for rockets) now works over the network, and
    for monsters
-   reduced ammo you can carry from 5 to 3 boxes each, and increased
    ammo respawn times by 33%.
-   machinegun now has mild inaccuracy at distance
-   fixed shotgun (all rays are now individual so you can hit multiple
    targets optimally, better spread pattern, slightly wider)
-   fixed all hitscan weapons not stopping at first target
-   fixed RL splash damage, now does more damage in radius and rocket
    jumps work better
-   masterserver functionality restored
-   added flare particles to help emphasize hitscan weapons
-   interpretation of cubes edges switched from \'edgepan\' to
    \'vector\'
-   passthrough command. normally cubes of equal size to the grid are
    given priority when selecting; passthrough removes this priority
    while held down. (default key: LCTRL)
-   fixed ghost/disconnection problems in multiplayer
-   \"allfaces\" var for texturing all faces at once
-   \"writeobj\" command writes a sauer level out as .obj file for
    potential use in other apps.
-   added \"text particles\": small bits of text that can float in 3d
    space. Currently used for damage numbers (red) and other gameplay
    events (green).
-   gameplay changes: pistol damage 40 -\> 25
-   \"mastermode\" for having easy, cheater-free multiplayer games with
    the people you want. Read the section \"Cheating & Multiplayer\" in
    game.html to learn how to use it.
-   gettex command
-   fixed sky HOM when fog was closer than size of world

2005\_11\_07\_agc\_edition {#_2005_11_07_agc_edition}
--------------------------

-   warning will appear if player cannot see most of selection when
    trying to edit
-   selecting now ignores the cube the player is currently in
-   \"importcube\" command for converting old cube maps
-   fixed animation blending
-   fixed being at the surface of water generating many sound events
-   did an endless amount of more refactoring to seperate the game code
    out more. Multiple \"games\" can now coexist in the same exe
-   \"lanconnect\" command for broadcasting connection requests over a
    LAN
-   \"maxparticledistance\" variable culls all particle splashes at
    distance
-   \"maxmodelradiusdistance\" variable calls models at distance,
    relative to their size. One day we will render models as sprites in
    the distance, but for now this is a cheap way to significantly
    reduce the rendering load on large maps
-   \"loddistance\" sets the distance at which vertex array blocks of
    world geometry use a lower LOD approximation. Significantly reduces
    amount of small detail rendered at distance. Useful on larger maps
    only.
-   \"lodsize\" must be set to 32 to turn lod on for a map (use only for
    really large maps), 0 turns it off. saved with the map.

    probably allocate dynamically in future to save mem)

    gentris().

    entered through the console. this will convert older maps that had
    problems because of recent updates. it acts as a toggle. \"fixmap\"
    will not be a part of future exe s, and I haven\'t bothered putting
    it in the source code.
