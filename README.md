# Bube - A Sauerbraten fork
Bube is a fork of Sauerbraten, To... well, I don't have a finalised goal.\
This is *not* Sauerbraten, You can find that project [here](http://sauerbraten.org/).

## Changes - thus far;
 * Restructured the repository.
 * Switched to GIT from SVN.
 * Switched to CMake :feelsgood:

## Planned Changes
- [ ] Increase size of maps.
- [ ] Increase hard-coded limits in general.
- [ ] Remove some hard-coded stuff.
- [ ] Add a scripting language.
- [ ] Public domain example game.
- [ ] Potentially replace GUI with better library.

## Planned Features
- [x] Backwards-compatability with Cube 2 mods/games\
      (Status on this *may* change in the future).

## License
