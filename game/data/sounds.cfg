// I've removed the hard-coded load order by changing name to, well, a name - and added a filepath argument.
// Of-course, sound names remain hard-coded.
// NOTE: If a filepath isn't present, it is assumed to be the same as the name!
// You can find a readme at the root of every sound directory stating its' license.
